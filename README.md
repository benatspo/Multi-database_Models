# Multi-database Models
This repository is the replication package for the paper: "An Empirical Study of (Multi-) Database Models in Open-Source Projects"

It permits to (rebuild or) use the surveyed database to replicate the observed results, and to filter/update/complete the dataset.

Link to download the SQLite database containing all the data for the replication: [SQL_NoSQL_Survey.db](https://figshare.com/s/fb5c35279ab68ec52ffc)

A Jupyter notebook is available in the jupyter_notebook folder. Download the database, put it in the same folder than the Jupyter notebook file, and start using the notebook which contains all the prepared queries to replicate the results of the paper.
